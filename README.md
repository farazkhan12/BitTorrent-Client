# BitTorrent-Client
Incomplete Client that verifies data blocks using SHA256 Hashing. This program a uses merkles tree's to test the validity of binary file data blocks. Attached is a merkle tree implementation and a hashing class using an open source PICO2SHA256 algorithm. The merkle tree uses methods to verify if a chain of exisiting hashes is valid and if adding a specific block will result in a correct merkle tree, or data validity. Merkle tree chains can also be made by adding data blocks to any amount. This is used to implement an incomplete bit-torrent client that reads in binary files and determines if they have been corrupted or if they belong or not. It also creates valid torrent file by taking in dating blocks with 32bit hex hashes and creating a merkle tree of size n, where n is the number of data blocks in the binary file. These blocks ultimately create a root hash, which is then stored in the torrent file along with, number of blocks(4byte integer), and character array representing the original data files file name and relative path.
This client takes in data via command line arguments 
./BitTorrent -c <file>.torrent <file> //this creates a torrent file if you feed in a valid binary file with hashes 
./BitTorrent -v <file>.torrent <file> //reads a torrent file root hash and determine integrity of the file
